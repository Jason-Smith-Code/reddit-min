SEARCH

By default We need to be able to search without a subreddit
	a base search will show 2 lists
		subreddits
		posts
	if no results are found show this to the user

We can also select search for a subreddit separately
	We can select that subreddit and this will update the base search
	We can un select the subreddit and return to base search
	when we have a subreddit selected, it will show to the user
	if no results are found show this to the user

If search is empty, prevent search
