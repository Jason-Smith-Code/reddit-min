## Application Description

This is a miniture version of reddit, the applicaton allows the user to perform a search which will return results from reddits API.
A user can search for posts and subreddits, comments can also be view on each post.

## Objective

The primary object is to work with reddit API. To capture that data in the form of JSON, and then work with that data to render its results to the user.
There are 3 main arrays of data that I will be looking for, posts, subreddits and comments. These all need to be loaded to the user when they perform a search, I also want to render default results prior to search.
Regarding responsive design, I want to hide the subreddits in an offscreen menu so that they can be accessed over the posts, as the post list can be quite long I dont want the user to have to scroll far to reach them.

## What was my Workflow

- **âœ… Research Reddit** <br>
  Up until this point I have never used Reddit before, I spent some time browsing the site to understand how it worked.

- **âœ… Write up the idea of the project** <br>
  Once I understood how Reddit worked, I was able to draw up a miniture version by keep the core features of reddit without login, posting e.t.c. So this was effectively a read only reddit.

- **âœ… Decide on colour palette for the theme** <br>
  Coolors.co is a fantastic App to choose colours for a theme, testing combinations and contrast decided to go with purple hues and picked some cold and warm variations to separate foreground and background.<br>
  You can see my colour theme [here](https://coolors.co/ffffff-eee4d9-FC6A5F-A60D03-3b0d03).

- **âœ… Create a wireframe of Taskify** <br>
  Used wireframing tool [FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/) to plan out my application.<br>
  You can see the results of that work [here](src/images/screenShots/Figma.jpg)

- **âœ… Use github for version control** <br>
  Set up repository on github, and accessed it locally to start work using git commands to regularly add, commit, and push changes to the repository.

- **âœ… Install packages** <br>
  I had an idea what packages I was going to work with based on the features I wanted to include. Working with React, Jest for testing, redux toolkit for state management.

- **âœ… Setup file structure** <br>
  For this project I used create-react-app, I re-organised the file structure at a later date.

- **âœ… Create search** <br>


- **âœ… Implement Layout and theme** <br>
  Working from the wireframe I began to build the layout of the application then apply the colour theme.

- **âœ… Build the menu** <br>
- **Test application** <br>
  Testing started.

- **âœ… Add Mobile, tablet and desktopp optimisation** <br>
  I want the application to look great on all mobile, tablet and desktop, I used a mobile first css approach.

- **âœ… Create a build and deploy to github pages** <br>
  To showcase this application, I will use github pages as its free and easy to setup.
