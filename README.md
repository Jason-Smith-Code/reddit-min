## Application Description

## Objective

## What was my Workflow

- **âœ… Research Reddit** <br>

- **âœ… Write up the idea of the project** <br>

- **âœ… Decide on colour palette for the theme** <br>
  Coolors.co is a fantastic App to choose colours for a theme, testing combinations and contrast decided to go with purple hues and picked some cold and warm variations to separate foreground and background.<br>
  You can see my colour theme [here](https://coolors.co/69009e-9e0091-ff00b1-c2a5bc-c1e9f1).

- **âœ… Create a wireframe of Taskify** <br>
  Used wireframing tool [FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/) to plan out my application.<br>
  You can see the results of that work [here](src/images/screenShots/Figma.jpg)

- **âœ… Use github for version control** <br>
  Set up repository on github, and accessed it locally to start work using git commands to regularly add, commit, and push changes to the repository.

- **âœ… Install packages** <br>
  I had an idea what packages I was going to work with based on the features I wanted to include. Working with React, Jest for testing, redux toolkit for state management.

- **âœ… Setup file structure** <br>
  For this project I used create-react-app, I re-organised the file structure and began adding javascript files.

- **âœ… Create search** <br>

- **âœ… Implement Layout and theme** <br>
  Working from the wireframe I began to build the layout of the application then apply the colour theme.

- **âœ… Build the menu** <br>
- **Test application** <br>
  Testing started.

- **âœ… Add Mobile, tablet and desktopp optimisation** <br>
  I want the application to look great on all mobile, tablet and desktop, I used a mobile first css approach.

- **âœ… Create a build and deploy to github pages** <br>
  To showcase this application, I will use github pages as its free and easy to setup.
